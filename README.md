# AI-Powered-Automation
Gesture-based automation has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential 
for creating intuitive and efficient human-computer interaction systems. In this project, we 
propose an AI Gesture-Based Automation system with Mesh Detection using OpenCV on 
Python and the PyFirmata protocol. The objective of this project is to develop a reliable and 
accurate gesture recognition system that can interpret human hand movements and perform 
corresponding actions in an automated environment. 
The proposed system utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, for real-time video 
processing and hand gesture detection. Furthermore, the system incorporates mesh 
detection techniques to identify specific gestures and map them to predefined commands or 
actions. 
To control external devices and automation systems, the project employs the PyFirmata 
protocol, which allows communication with Arduino using the Python programming 
language. By establishing a connection between the gesture recognition system and the 
automation hardware, the project enables the execution of actions based on recognized 
gestures. 
The developed system offers several potential applications, such as home automation, 
interactive presentations, and virtual reality control. By eliminating the need for physical 
interfaces or input devices, users can seamlessly interact with the automation system through 
natural hand gestures, enhancing user experience and convenience.
